# loginGame (TEMP NAME)
This project is to help seniors practice logging in online and getting used to online forms and their different forms. 

This project is tailored towards senior citizen. It will use automatically generated passwords and usernames but will give the seniors the answer. They just have to put it into the right spot. 

### Goal 
The goal of this project is to have seniors feel more comfortable with some different types of signin pages. Also how to use different aspects, such as " show password " features to give them guidence. 

TODO: Currently I might make the usernames and passwords static so they could also practice with autofill password managers.  

TODO: The project will go through a variety of different login screens, allowing users to practice with a standard login page to MFA pages.
